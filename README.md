Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Agustin, a Software Developer student at Brigham Young University-Idaho. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I started my first Software development position at Primero System on January 2024, where I'm learning a lot, mainly about React and .Net. For the last 4 to 5 years, I've been taking different classes at BYU. Most of them related to software development, but also many soft skills and general topics. I'm currently taking a class that required me to learn several technologies, creating a new project with a different technology every two weeks. It's a super exciting class! On the next term I'll take another class that will require me to create a bigger project. My goal is to graduate and obtain my BS degree in Software Development by the end of this year (2025).

Most of my repositories here were created as part of those classes as I learned new skills and technologies. Here are a few that I liked working on:
_ Recipes App, built with Angular: https://github.com/AgustinAguilarDev/recipes-app
_ Studies Organizer App, also built with Angular: https://github.com/AgustinAguilarDev/studies-organizer
_ CMS or Contacts App, built with Angular: https://github.com/AgustinAguilarDev/cms-
