Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Agustin, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in software development. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I've been taking different classes at BYU for the last 4 to 5 years. Most of them related to software development, but also many soft skills and general topics. I'm currently taking a class that required me to learn several technologies, creating a new project with a different technology every two weeks. It's a super exciting class! On the next term I'll take another class that will require me to create a bigger project.
Most of my repositories here were created as part of those classes as I learned new skills and technologies.
My goal is to graduate and obtain my BS degree in Software Development by the end of this year (2025).
